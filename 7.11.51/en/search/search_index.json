Each Region consists of three Availability Zones (AZs), that is three Data Centers configured for business continuity, separated as the crow flies by tens of kilometers.</p> <p>Specifically, the following table shows the DC association for each region:</p> Region List of DCs Region A RM 1 Region A RM 2 Region A RM 3 Region B MI 1 Region B MI 2 Region B MI 3 Nomenclature of DCs for each Region <p>Below are the distances between the DCs of each Region.</p> <p>Region A:</p> <ul> <li>DC RM 1 - DC RM 2: approximate distance 30 km</li> <li>DC RM 1 - DC RM 3: approximate distance 30 km</li> <li>DC MR 2 - DC RM 3: approximate distance 15 km</li> </ul> <p>Region B:</p> <ul> <li>DC MI 1 - DC MI 2: approximate distance 53 km</li> <li>DC MI 1 - DC MI 3: approximate distance 54 km</li> <li>DC MI 2 - DC MI 3: approximate distance 10 km</li> </ul> <p>All data centers are equipped with all the necessary technical and technological infrastructure to guarantee the highest quality standards in terms of reliability, availability, and physical security. </p> <p>The three AZs are interconnected via a proprietary backbone, which guarantees complete redundancy, negligible latency, and private connectivity, logically characterizing the Regions as a single virtual Data Center (Software Defined Data Center).  </p> <p>The Regions are also interconnected via the same proprietary, dedicated, and reserved backbone with IP/MPLS network transmission, enabling a flexible, software-defined logical network architecture, ensuring the mobility of application loads and the inherent high reliability of Cloud solutions. Within an Availability Zone, workloads are transparently distributed, and the HA (High Availability) configuration enables infrastructure service continuity (Business Continuity) between the three Data Centers in the same Region. </p> <p>Thanks to this basic configuration, the Cloud platform will also provide data distribution between the three zones of each Region. This configuration is possible thanks to the distribution of storage space (identified with the best Storage Array technologies available on the IT market) within the three AZs and, therefore, thanks to the continuous replication of data for the service chosen by each individual organization. Therefore, if an individual organization decides to leverage the full redundancy of its infrastructure (physical or virtual), it can leverage the Cloud platform's HA configuration and create DR/BC solutions.  </p> <p>The unique nature of the Cloud platform, thanks to the backbone interconnecting the three AZs that make up each Region, will enable synchronous and asynchronous data replication between the Storage Array systems that make up the Storage Tier. In this operational context, the individual organization will benefit from the Cloud platform's inherent ability to reactivate workloads within one of the three AZs or in a different Region. Restarting workloads protected by the activated DR/BC solution will therefore allow the individual organization to independently manage the restart of each application, based on its own DR or BC plans.</p>"},{"location":"DC/#network-description","title":"Network description","text":"<p>The network is structured around three main components: Data Center Interconnection, Wide Area Network, and Local Area Network.</p>"},{"location":"DC/#data-center-interconnection-dci","title":"Data Center Interconnection (DCI)","text":"<p>Interconnection between the Data Centers relies on a high-capacity transport infrastructure built to ensure minimal latency, fault tolerance, and uninterrupted service.

PAM allows organizations to activate a privileged access management system. Its purpose is to act as a bridge between users (especially administrators) and the systems they manage, ensuring that administrative credentials are protected within a \"vault\" and hidden from the administrators themselves. Furthermore, the system can rotate administrative credentials or deny access to an administrator on a per-profile basis. Privileged accounts \u2014 such as system administrators, database managers, and DevOps automation services \u2014 represent a primary attack vector for cybercriminals. Compromise of these accounts can lead to severe data breaches, ransomware propagation, or full system takeover. The PAM PaaS delivers identity-centric protection and governance for all privileged credentials, sessions, and activities across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments. It enforces the principle of least privilege, enables session monitoring and recording, and automates credential rotation, vaulting, and just-in-time access provisioning to minimize risk exposure.
