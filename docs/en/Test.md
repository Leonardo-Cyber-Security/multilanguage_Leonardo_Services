# Test Account Requests

This section defines the process for provisioning test accounts requested by customers.
The process ensures that customer requests for test accounts are handled in a controlled, timely, and secure manner. It includes request intake, validation, approval, provisioning, and delivery.

## Request submission process

Below you can view the sequence of the process for requesting a test account by an authorized user.

1) The customer sends a request via email to the support address listed here: <a href="mailto:lce.support@leonardo.com?subject=Test Account Request%20for%20....&body=Insert%20your%20specific%20requests%20following%20the%20instrucions%20">Invia un'email</a>

    The request must include:

    - Purpose of the test account
    - Number of accounts required
    - Specific access or roles needed
    - Contact details of the requester

2) The request is logged in the ticketing system upon receipt.

3) The Service Desk reviews the request to ensure completeness and technical feasibility. If additional information is required, the customer is contacted. The 10-day SLA starts once the request is validated as complete.

4) The Technical Team creates the test account(s) and applies:

    - Minimum required permissions
    - Applicable security policies
    - Expiration settings (if required)

A functionality check is performed to confirm proper access.

5) Within 10 business days, the customer receives an email including:

    - Credentials or activation instructions
    - Overview of assigned permissions
    - Account validity period
    - Contact information for support

The ticket is now then closed.
